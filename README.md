# Data Structures
Repository containing classic computer science data structure custom made for self-study purpose.


## Overview

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Licence

Project under [MIT Licence](https://mit-licence.igorabrandao.com.br/).

## How ​​to compile

Use the makefile by typing the **'make'** command from the terminal, after navigating to the project folder.

## Project structure

Currently implemented data structures:

**Array** => An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

**Matrix** => An array with N dimensions.

**Linked list** => A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

**Stack** => A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) principle.

- **Array version** => Needs to reallocate memory everytime the stack is full
- **Linked List version** => Needs to push the elements in front of the list since it's based on a single Linked List.

**Queue** => A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

- **Array version** => Needs to reallocate memory everytime the queue is full
- **Linked List version** => Needs to push the elements in the back of the list.

**Pair** => A pair is a class template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a single unit.

**Tree** => A tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

- **Generic tree** => Collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed). This tree doesn't have constraint related to the number of children

**Hashmap** => Unordered map is an associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Search, insertion, and removal of elements have average constant-time complexity.
